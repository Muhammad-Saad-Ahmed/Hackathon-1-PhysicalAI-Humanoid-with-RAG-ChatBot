## Prompt

textbook-generation

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive specification for textbook generation feature. The specification includes:

- User scenarios for generating custom textbook content (P1 priority), customizing format and style (P2 priority), and exporting/sharing textbooks (P3 priority)
- 10 functional requirements covering content generation, structuring, validation, export, and quality checks
- 4 key entities: Textbook, Generation Parameters, Content Block, and Export Format
- 6 measurable success criteria including generation time, accuracy, audience matching, and export capabilities

The specification is complete with no implementation details, focusing on user value and business needs. All mandatory sections are completed and validated with a quality checklist.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete feature specification for textbook generation
- 🧪 Tests:
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.plan to create implementation plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification covers core textbook generation functionality with appropriate user scenarios and measurable outcomes
