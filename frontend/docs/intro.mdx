# Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

# Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

This textbook provides a comprehensive overview of the exciting field of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Our goal is to equip you with the foundational knowledge and practical skills needed to understand, design, and build intelligent robotic systems that can interact with the physical world.

## What to Expect

In this book, we will explore the core concepts of humanoid robotics, from the mechanics of motion to the complexities of AI-driven perception and decision-making. You will learn about:

- The history and evolution of humanoid robots.
- The fundamental hardware and software components that make up a robotic system.
- The principles of kinematics, dynamics, and control.
- The role of simulation in modern robotics development.
- The application of cutting-edge AI, including Vision Language Models (VLAs), in robotics.
- The process of building and programming a complete robotic system through a capstone project.

## Who is This Book For?

This book is designed for a wide range of learners, from university students in computer science and engineering to professionals looking to transition into the field of robotics. A basic understanding of programming and mathematics is recommended, but we have made an effort to make the material accessible to a broad audience.
