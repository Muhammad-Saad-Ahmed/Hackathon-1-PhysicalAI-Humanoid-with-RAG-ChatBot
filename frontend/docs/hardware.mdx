# Hardware

This chapter delves into the essential hardware components that form the physical body and sensory systems of humanoid robots. A robot is more than just its code; it is a physical entity that must perceive and act upon its environment.

## Actuators and Motors

The ability of a robot to move is made possible by actuators. We will discuss the various types of actuators used in modern robotics, including:

-   **Electric Motors**: The most common type of actuator, including DC motors, stepper motors, and brushless motors.
-   **Hydraulic Actuators**: Used in robots that require high power and force, such as Boston Dynamics' Atlas.
-   **Pneumatic Actuators**: Lightweight and fast, often used for grippers and other smaller movements.

## Sensors

For a robot to interact intelligently with its environment, it must be able to perceive it. This section covers the array of sensors that give robots their senses:

-   **Vision Sensors**: Cameras (monocular, stereo, and 360-degree) are the primary sensors for most humanoid robots.
-   **Proprioceptive Sensors**: These sensors measure the internal state of the robot, such as joint angles, motor torque, and battery levels.
-   **Exteroceptive Sensors**: These sensors gather information about the external world, including LiDAR, sonar, and tactile sensors.

## Computational Hardware

The "brain" of the robot is its computational hardware. This section will explore the various computing platforms used in robotics, from powerful single-board computers to distributed systems. We will also discuss the importance of real-time processing and the role of specialized hardware like GPUs and TPUs for AI and machine learning tasks.
