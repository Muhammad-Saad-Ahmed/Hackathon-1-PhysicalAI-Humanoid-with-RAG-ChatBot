# Capstone Project

# Capstone Project

The capstone project is the culmination of all the concepts and skills you have learned throughout this textbook. In this project, you will apply your knowledge to design, build, and program a simulated humanoid robot that can perform a variety of tasks.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of the capstone project is to provide a hands-on, practical experience in robotics. You will be challenged to integrate all the different subsystems of a robot, including hardware, software, perception, and control, into a single, functioning system.

## Project Scope

The project will be carried out entirely in simulation, using the tools and techniques you have learned in the previous chapters. The scope of the project includes:

1.  **Robot Design**: You will start by designing your robot in a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file. This will involve specifying the links, joints, and sensors of your robot.
2.  **Simulation Setup**: You will then import your robot into a simulator, such as Gazebo, and set up a virtual environment for it to interact with.
3.  **Software Development**: You will write the software for your robot using ROS2. This will include nodes for controlling the robot's motion, processing sensor data, and implementing high-level behaviors.
4.  **Task-based Challenges**: You will be given a series of tasks to complete with your robot, such as navigating to a specific location, picking up an object, or interacting with a human user.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of the capstone project, you will have:

-   A deep understanding of the challenges and complexities of building a complete robotic system.
-   Practical experience in using industry-standard tools and technologies, such as ROS2 and Gazebo.
-   A portfolio piece that demonstrates your skills and knowledge in robotics.
-   The confidence to tackle real-world robotics problems.
